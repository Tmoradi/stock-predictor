#### Q2) What is exponential smoothing and why is it used in Time Series Forecasting?

exponential smoothing is a technique for smoothing time series data using an exponential smoothing function. It is used in Time Series Forecasting because it allows us to emphasize current data over previous data instead of treating all data with equal weight.

#### Q3) What is stationarity? What is seasonality? Why Is Stationarity Important in Time Series Forecasting

Stationary means that a time series whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed, it is important in Time Series forecasting because it is a core assumptions for a lot of model techniques to hold valid. Seasonality are repeating regular patterns of fluctuations in our data.

### Q4) How is seasonality different from cyclicality? Fill in the blanks:

Seasonality is a regular repeating pattern of up / down flucuations, and cyclicality has ups and down but aren't as regular as seasonality. Cyclicality is usually longer-term patterns.
seasonality is predictable whereas cyclicality is not.
